# ***Hi***! :heart:



## Who am i?

My name is Gabriel!
>Shocker! I know...

... Seriously though...

I am a Brazillian ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡· programmer and game developer who likes retro games!
>By retro games, i mean either the nes/atari era of pixelart or the late 90s/early 2000s pre-rendered and 3D graphics.

## What am i doing with my existence?

Existing... I suppose...

... Seriously though! ( Second time this text file... )

I am currently learning lots of things, one of these things is using GitHub... i have been programming for years ( On and off of course... Because i am stupid... ) and still don't really know...
Other than that i am learning Pixelart, 3D Modelling, Music theory ( This one is the hardest by far... )

Basically, i want to become a "Jack of all trades" in Game Development, it's kinda my dream in life.
So i am learning as much as i can!
